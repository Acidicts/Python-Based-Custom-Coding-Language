# Python Based Custom Interpreter
- Made with the tutorial by [ComputerPhile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2UDHY5as90&t=795s&ab_channel=Computerphile)

- My version adds the ability to use the print function

# Future Plans:
- simplify pygame with it

# How to use:
- Run the interpt.py file
`python interpt.py <filename>.acd`
- The file extension must be .acd
